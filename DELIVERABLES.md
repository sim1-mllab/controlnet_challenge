# Assumptions:
- python is a generally accepted programming language and for showcasing no consideration for other languages is needed
- to showcase the potential of the technology, a small demo is sufficient
- the demo should be easy to set up and run
- the demo should be easy to understand
- the demo should be easy to extend


# 1. Analysis of Use Case
## GOAL:
Set up small demo to allow SBU to see the potential of the technology in their production systems.

- define requirements
  - hardware (CUDA, sufficient storage space)
  - software (python packages)
  - data


## Current situation
- toy-script (notebook style)
- no fixed package requirements
- no hard-ware requirements
- current python version is 3.8.5 (https://devguide.python.org/versions/),
  - deprecated version
  - not applicable to Apple Silicon - temporary installation with Rosetta - earliest ist 3.8.11 (running `conda search python --platform osx-arm64`)
- github repository is available, but not in active development, latest commit 2023 --> needs replacement on the
  long-run (self-written or third-party package under active development with high contribution rate)

# Use Case: Deployment of ControlNet for Image Generation

ControlNet is a method that fine-tunes pre-trained diffusion models using smaller, specialized external networks,
offering a more efficient alternative to training large models from scratch.
Initially designed to control the image generation process, ControlNet has since evolved to condition image generation
on text prompts (as seen in Stable Diffusion, Fig. 1a) or more specific image prompts, expanding its versatility.

This evolution allows ControlNet to generate highly customized images from a single reference image while incorporating
parameters like depth, size, and other specific features. This is especially valuable in scenarios where obtaining
real-world training data is costly, scarce, or difficult, such as in manufacturing with low yield rates.

## Applications:
- Synthetic Data Generation for Object Detection:
    ControlNet can generate synthetic images to simulate real-world conditions, enabling the training of object detection
      models when real-world data is limited.
- Defect Detection in Machined Components:
    By leveraging external networks specialized in depth inference, ControlNet can generate 3D reconstructions of objects,
      which can help identify defects in manufacturing processes.
- Image Restoration:
  ControlNet can be used to enhance or restore images taken in poor conditions (e.g., low light, high noise), which can
    be useful in quality control, medical imaging, and other fields requiring high-quality visual data.

## Considerations and Challenges:
- Efficiency: While ControlNet is a powerful tool, specialized hardware (e.g., stereo sensors for depth information)
    may offer more accurate and efficient solutions for certain tasks. AI models should be evaluated based on the
    problem at hand, as not all challenges are best solved with machine learning.
- Scalability and Complexity: The ability to generate large amounts of parameterized images could lead to the creation
    of models that are costly to maintain and may not offer significant advantages over simpler models.
    Careful evaluation of use cases is necessary to ensure efficiency and practicality.

## Conclusion:
ControlNet's ability to generate realistic, customized images based on text or image prompts opens up a range of
applications, particularly when data is difficult to obtain. However, its use should be carefully considered to ensure
it provides a more effective and efficient solution compared to other, more traditional methods.
